Polymorphism

<!-- What does the word 'polymorphism' mean? -->

a feature that means you can use different variable types at different times.

<!-- What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example. -->

We are able to give properties from an abstract class to many classes which might not directly inherit.

<!-- What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java? -->

abstract class square, child class circle

<!-- How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism? -->

2, static and non-static polymorphism

<!-- Give an example of when you could use polymorphism. -->

When you have child classes inheriting from an abstract class but also classes that do not inherit
but can use some of properties within the super class.

Composition
<!-- What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming? -->

when properties within a class also have their own individual classes.

<!-- When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java. -->

Class:Dealership has properties Till,Dealer. both Till and Dealer have their own class with
other properties within them.

<!-- What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition? -->

Flexibility over other features like inheritance.

<!-- What happens to the behaviours when the object composed of them is destroyed? -->
they are also destroyed.
